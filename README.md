## Project Scope

WeatherApp is a feature-rich weather application designed to:
- Display current weather information for a selected location.
- Provide a detailed 7-day weather forecast.
- Allow users to get weather information based on their current location.

## Core Features

1. **Current Weather Information**
   - Shows current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and conditions.
   - Uses the `http` package for API integration.

2. **Detailed Forecast**
   - Provides a 7-day forecast with detailed weather information.
   - Utilizes the `animations` package for smooth transitions between forecast days.

3. **Location-Based Weather**
   - Fetches weather data based on the user’s current location.
   - Implements the `geolocator` package to retrieve location data.

**Packages Used:**
- `http` for making network requests.
- `geolocator` for accessing the device's location.
- `provider` for state management.
- `animations` for custom animations and transitions.

## State Management

- **Provider with ChangeNotifier**
  - Manages app-wide state for weather data using `Provider` and `ChangeNotifier`.
  - Ensures UI updates when weather data changes.

- **Riverpod (Optional)**
  - Provides an alternative state management solution with `Riverpod` for more modular state management.

## Responsive Design

- Uses Flutter’s `MediaQuery` to handle different screen sizes and orientations.
- Implements `Flexible` and `Expanded` widgets to create a responsive layout.

## API Integration

- **Weather API:**
  - Fetches real-time weather data and forecasts from the OpenWeatherMap API.
  - Example code to fetch weather data:
    ```dart
    Future<WeatherData> fetchWeather(String location) async {
      final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=$location&appid=YOUR_API_KEY'));
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        return WeatherData.fromJson(jsonDecode(response.body));
      } else {
        throw Exception('Failed to load weather data');
      }
    }
    ```

## Advanced UI/UX

- **Custom Animations and Transitions:**
  - Utilizes the `animations` package for smooth and engaging transitions.
  - Includes animated weather icons and transitions between forecast days.

- **Polished User Interface:**
  - Features a clean and intuitive design with custom widgets for weather data display.
  - Thoughtful user interactions and gestures for an enhanced user experience.

## Documentation

- **Project Structure:**
  - `lib/`: Main application code.
    - `models/`: Data models (e.g., WeatherData).
    - `providers/`: State management providers.
    - `screens/`: UI screens (e.g., HomeScreen, ForecastScreen).
    - `widgets/`: Custom widgets (e.g., WeatherCard, ForecastCard).
  - `pubspec.yaml`: Dependency management.
  - `README.md`: Project documentation.

- **Design Decisions:**
  - UI/UX design choices are explained in the `design.md` file.
  - State management strategies and package choices are detailed in `state_management.md`.
